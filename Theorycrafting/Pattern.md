Being a 3 socketed runeword that can only be made in Claws, the following base types can be used: Claws/up, Blade Talons/up, Scissors Katar/up, Suwayyah, and Wrist Sword.

3os Claws can be found as early as Act 4 Normal, but can be reliably found in Normal Cows at the earliest. Any earlier than Normal Cows may run the risk of getting a 0os claw that can only get 2os from socketing. Claws can drop as 3os in normal.

Thul Rune can be farmed from Nightmare Countess.

Notes:
- 30% Faster Block Rate applies to Weapon Block (Claw Block) and reduces block length from 5 frames to 4 frames.

### Usage

Not much to say, its alright. Trapsin will likely still be the meta leveling option, but having an option like this for those that don't want to level as Trapsin is nice. The rainbow damage is nice for early game.
