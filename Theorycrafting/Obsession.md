### Compared to Heart of the Oak and Spirit

I've seen a lot people saying Obsession sucks because HOTO + Spirit is better (for Sorceresses). I think they do not know how to do basic math because Obsession is definitely better. Let's compare:

| HOTO + Spirit | Obsession |
| --- | --- |
| +5 All Skills | +4 All Skills |
| 65-75% FCR | 65% FCR |
| 55% FHR | 60% FHR |
| 22 Vitality | 10 Vitality |
| - | Increase Max Life 15-25% |
| Increase Max Mana 15% | - |
| 89-112 Mana | - |
| - | 10 Energy |
| - | Regenerate Mana 15-30% |
| 30-40 Fire Res | 60-70 Fire Res |
| 65-75 Cold Res | 60-70 Cold Res |
| 65-75 Light Res | 60-70 Light Res |
| 65-75 Poison Res | 60-70 Poison Res |

So let's compare the differences:\
HOTO + Spirit has +1 skills, 0-10% FCR, 12 Vitality, Increase Max Mana 15%, 89-112 Mana, and 5 Cold/Light/Poison Res.\
Obsession has 5% FHR, Increase Max Life 15-25%, 10 Energy, Regenerate Mana 15-30%, and 30 Fire Res.

Comparing face value stats, HOTO + Spirit is slightly better. However, let's look at stats not relevant to the runeword itself:\
Obsession can be put into a Staff with +Skills already on it, meaning +7 to skill compared to HOTO + Spirit's +5.\
War Staff has no strength requirement. None. You no longer need 156 Strength. The most you might ever need is 77 for Dusk Shroud. Let's assume you had to invest 60 points into Strength to wear Spirit Monarch. This returns 120 life for a Sorceress which then scales with Battle Orders. Keep in mind, hard points into Vitality are worth more than soft points into Vitality, as soft points into Vitality do not scale with Battle Orders or Oak Sage!\
55% FHR from Spirit is actually only worth 42% FHR, as that is the breakpoint that 55% FHR hits. The next FHR breakpoint is at, you guessed it, 60% FHR, so Obsession hits a higher breakpoint. You no longer need an additional 5% FHR SC to hit this breakpoint.\
Obsession gives significantly more life while HOTO + Spirit gives significantly more mana, so we can just call it even in that regard.\
30 Fire Res from Obession is a pretty big upgrade for 5 less res in everything else (that's a pretty good trade off if you ask me).\
HOTO + Spirit can get up to 10% more FCR. Does this make a different in obtaining breakpoints? No. The only difference that exists now is if you want to hit 200% FCR breakpoint, you need 10 extra FCR on your Amulet. That 10 extra FCR on HOTO + Spirit doesn't make it BiS though (otherwise Skin of the Vipermagi would be BiS). A 200 FCR Sorc makes sacrifices (uses Skin of the Vipermagi instead of Chains of Honor or Ormus' Robes), surely they can make another sacrifice and use HOTO + Spirit or get a 20 FCR Amulet.

Thus, Obsession is better for Sorceress.

### Sorceress Usage

Obsession wouldn't be BiS for a Cold Sorc, as Death's Fathom still takes the cake. However, for a Lightning or Fire Sorceress, this certainly does it.

### Druid Usage

Obsession is inferior to HOTO + Spirit for non-Sorceress builds by way of +1 Skill, but Druid benefits a lot from life, so Obsession may be preferred.

### Paladin Usage

I don't see a Hammerdin using this. They don't have Strength problems and really benefit from Holy Shield. They also have terrible FHR breakpoints when wielding staves.

### Assassin Usage

I don't see a Trapsin using this either. War Staff/up have really slow WSM, so trap laying will feel pretty poor.
