Being a 3 socketed runeword that can only be made in helms, the following base types can be used: Great Helm/up, Mask/up, Crown/up, Tiara/up, and Bone Visage. This means: Great Helm, Winged Helm, Spired Helm, Mask, Death Mask, Demonhead, Crown, Grand Crown, Corona, Bone Visage, Tiara, and Diadem. No other helm can get 3os.

I will refer to the value of a runeword by the sum of its most notable runes. Wisdom be valued at 'Pul'.

3os-capable Helms can be found as early as Nightmare Jail, but helms cannot drop with 3 open sockets in Nightmare, so they must be cube or quest socketed. Any of the mention helms can drop 3os in Hell.

A Pul rune can drop from Nightmare Hellforge and can be farmed from Hell Countess.

Notes:
- Piercing Attack has a hidden % Pierce given and it varies per application. Razortail's is 33% while Buriza's is 100%.
- Piercing Attack does stack with pierce, gained from the Amazon passive Pierce or the upcoming Throwing Mastery change which will give pierce as well.

### Amazon Usage

The only true merit to this item is the pierce. None of the other modifiers are worth investing a Pul rune into. Another CBF source is nice, but in the case of most Bowazons and especially Javazons, the helm is an important damage slot, and so I believe Wisdom is only good until Razortail is found, depending on the amount of pierce Wisdom provides. + Skills are better for both Javazons and non-physical Bowazons (Lore, Shako, Griffon's, Nightwing's) once Razortail is obtained. For physical Bowazons, its useful until a better helm is found, which is typically an exceptional or elite unique or set helm or a helm filled with ED% and/or IAS jewels.

### Barbarian Usage

With the upcoming change to Throwing Mastery to provide pierce, this may be a notable mid level helm option until something that provides better stats or damage is found (Arreats?). This assuming Throw Barb becomes vital with the changes in 2.4.

### Act 1 Mercenary Usage

Since the [only source of pierce available to the Act 1 Mercenary is Kuko Shakaku](https://theamazonbasin.com/wiki/index.php/Pierce), this item offers another potential mercenary item. The only thing of concern is the helm slot for mercenaries is typically reserved to sustain, and Wisdom has no sustain or any defensive properties. I don't imagine this alone will make Act 1 Mercenaries any better than they currently are.
