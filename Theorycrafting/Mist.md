Being a 5 socketed runeword that can only be made in Bows (unconfirmed), all bows except: Short Bow/up, Hunter's Bow/up, and Composite Bow/up.

Notes:
- Piercing Attack at 100% means for as long as the hit-check suceeds, any attack made will pierce 4 times, hitting 5 targets (assuming there are targets to collide with).

### Amazon Usage

I don't see this being viable for a Frostmaiden. The only merit is +3 skills and the defensive mods. It's already straightforward for a Bowazon or any Amazon to hit 100% pierce, so it's not game changing that this item has 100% pierce. I also don't see the merit for a physical Bowazon either, Faith and Windforce are both still better. Could be a cheaper alternative while waiting to get a Faith or Windforce, but don't see it being BiS. The damage of Faith and Windforce are both higher than what Mist could obtain. Could be pretty good for a Fire Bowazon though. Freezes Target would force monsters to stand in immolation fire. Put it into a GMB with +3 Bow skills, thats +6.

### Act 1 Mercenary Usage

This is definitely the use case for this runeword. I see this being a cheap alternative to Faith or Pride (Cham and Gul are much cheaper than Jahs, Surs, and Los) for non-speed demanding builds, like Smiter, Zealot, maybe Frenzy Barb, physical Kicksin, etc. 100% pierce helps Act 1 Mercenary damage, and if the new skills the Act 1 Mercenaries get are AoE, 100% pierce can be huge here.
