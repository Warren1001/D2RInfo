Minimum Level Req: 55

- PLR 50%

Being a 3 socketed runeword that can only be made in Helms, the following base types can be used: Great Helm/up, Mask/up, Crown/up, Tiara/up, Bone Visage, all Druid Pelts, and all Barbarian Helms. This means: Great Helm, Winged Helm, Spired Helm, Mask, Death Mask, Demonhead, Crown, Grand Crown, Corona, Bone Visage, Tiara, Diadem, all Pelts, and all Barbarian Helms. No other helm can get 3os.

Level 8 Resist Fire gives 106 Fire Res. This will make summons/pets immune to fire if they do not have negative resistances!

Notes:
- Resist Fire on Equip does not provide synergy bonus to Holy Fire on Equip, so combining this with Hand of Justice or Dragon does not improve Fire Damage.
- +3 Fire Skills does not apply to auras on equip, and will not improve Resist Fire to level 11.

### Druid Usage

It's obvious that this is a best in slot helm for a Fire Druid, weak as they may currently be. Putting this into a 3os Pelt that has +Volcano or +whatever is +6 to the respective skill with some additional -fire res and passive fire res on top of it. This would make all Druid pets immune to fire as well.

### Sorceress Usage

For a Fire Sorc, this could be doable. It's hard to pass up alternative options. A 2/20 Sorceress circlet with 2os socketed with fire Facets would be better most likely.

### Amazon Usage

This could be good for a Fire Bowazon. A Fire Bowazon doesn't have a dedicated helm slot besides obtaining +Skills, so this could certainly be used in replacement of Shako. A 2 Zon Circlet with 2os with fire Facets will probably end up being better though.

### Assassin Usage

Notes:
- -res and +dmg% do not apply to Traps currently

I could see this being used for a Fire Trapper. Since Facets don't work for traps, a 2 Sin Circlet with 2 Facets wouldn't be better. However, the -res on this runeword doesn't apply to traps either, so this is purely +3 Fire Skills and the Aura on Equip being useful here. Shako may end up being more preferred.

### Necromancer Usage

I wouldn't say this is a best in slot item for Summonmancer, and may not even end up being used, but it would make all Necromancer summons/revives immune to fire damage (as long as they did not have negative resistances before). I don't see it being used for CE though.

### Mercenary Usage

This could be used to beef up the Fire Act 3 Mercenary, though I doubt they will prove to be any useful even after their adjustment in 2.4. It could also be used to improve Fire Arrow skills of the Act 1 Mercenary and provide another aura to the party.
