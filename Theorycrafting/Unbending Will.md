Level 18 Taunt provides: -39% Damage and Attack Rating to affected monsters.\
Taunt as a proc will automatically select the closest monster to the caster (usually the monster being attacked) and Taunt it. Taunt does not have AoE. Taunt is a curse and will override and be overridden by other curses. In practicality, this means improved survivability against the monster being attacked and preventing it from running away/kiting after Taunt procs (except for monsters with "flee", like Fallen). [Here is a video demo of how Taunt works as a proc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at6rkCOXj-k).

Being a 6 socketed runeword that can only be made in swords, this reduces base options to 2 base types: Crystal Sword/up and Great Sword/up. This means Crystal Sword, Dimensional Blade, and Phase Blade and Great Sword, Executioner Sword, and Colossus Blade.

I will refer to the value of a runeword by the sum of its most notable runes. Unbending Will be valued at 'Fal'.

### Act 5 Mercs Usage

Notes:
- 3 to Combat Skills (Barb only) does not work for A5 mercs.
- Prevent Monster Heal does not work for mercs.

As a cheap runeword for an A5 Merc, its not terrible. Giving a rune-cheap runeword 330% ED was likely done because [A5 mercs using a one-handed sword will double the total weapon tooltip damage when using it](https://www.theamazonbasin.com/wiki/index.php?title=Barbarian_(mercenary)#Items). This means for it to be good on A5 mercs, it would need a substantial ED%. After running some numbers, a minimum roll Passion Cryptic Sword would do 213.2 avg dmg while an Unbending Will CB would do 371.95 avg dmg. A maximum roll Oath Cryptic Sword would do 360.8 avg dmg. We can see an Unbending Will CB does more damage for less cost than most damage runewords available to A5 mercs.

Comparing it to Lawbringer, which was the popular A5 merc choice (if you can even use the word popular here), obviously Lawbringer does less damage. However, Lawbringer provides Sanctuary aura, KB safety against undead, and allows the Mercenary to ignore physical immunity on undead monsters. Additionally, it has a Decrepify proc, which lowers physical resistance, breaking most physical immunity and providing great CC on the monster being attacked as well as increasing your damage too. Personally, I can see either option being taken depending on what the player wanted.

However, it is important to keep in mind that A5 mercs would not use Crystal Sword/up as they are low damage weapons. This leaves Great Sword/up. Colossus Blade is a TC 85 item, making it rare (how often do you see a Giant Thresher? Giant Thresher is roughly the same rarity). This means that the likelihood of you upgrading past Unbending Will before finding a CB is quite high. So in practicality, this leaves Executioner Sword. Not too difficult to find. Unbending Will Executioner Sword has an avg dmg of 273.05, still better than a Passion Cryptic Sword.

An Act 5 Mercenary will have [the following breakpoints when using an Executioner Sword](https://warren1001.github.io/IAS_Calculator/experimental/?data=eyJjaGFyYWN0ZXIiOjksIndlcmVmb3JtIjoiTm9uZSIsInB3ZWFwb24iOiJFeGVjdXRpb25lciBTd29yZCIsInNraWxsIjoiU3RhbmRhcmQiLCJzd2VhcG9uIjoiQ29sb3NzdXMgQmxhZGUiLCJ0YWJsZXZhciI6InRhYmxlVmFyaWFibGVJQVMiLCJwd2lhcyI6IjAiLCJzd2lhcyI6IjAiLCJpYXMiOiIwIiwiZmFuYXQiOiIwIiwiYm9zIjoiMCIsInd3IjoiMCIsImZyZW56eSI6IjAiLCJoZiI6IjAiLCJkZWNyZXAiOmZhbHNlLCJvbmVoYW5kIjpmYWxzZSwid3NtYnVnIjpmYWxzZX0=). At only 20 IAS, that is a 15 frame animation length for all skills. However, Act 5 Mercenaries swing twice for their standard attack. This means ~7.5 frame intervals to proc Taunt. At ~7.5 frame intervals and 18% chance to cast, the Mercenary will cast Taunt on the closest monster every ~1.5 seconds on average. However, this is has a lot of redundancy, as Act 5 Mercenaries use "Stun", which is already permanent safety against the monster they are currently attacking. Taunt would only come in handy against monsters which cannot be stunned (Champions+).

You can get an Executioner Sword 0os from Nightmare Travincal or later and socket quest it for 6os. Fal rune can be farmed from nightmare LK or Hell Countess.

### Barbarian Usage

For sake of simplicity, a Barbarian would only realistically use Unbending Will in a Phase Blade, Executioner Sword, or Colossus Blade. Additionally, for non-Unbending Will runeword options, I'm assuming that only Phase Blade, Cryptic Sword, Colossus Blade, and Colossus Sword will be utilized.

Using this as a cheap option for an early/mid level Whirlwind Barbarian is not bad. It's important to note that CTCs do not work with Whirlwind, so the Taunt will never proc. It's also important to note that [20 IAS is not enough IAS to hit maximum Whirlwind frames in most cases](https://warren1001.github.io/IAS_Calculator/experimental/?data=eyJjaGFyYWN0ZXIiOjIsIndlcmVmb3JtIjoiTm9uZSIsInB3ZWFwb24iOiJQaGFzZSBCbGFkZSIsInNraWxsIjoiV2hpcmx3aW5kIiwic3dlYXBvbiI6IkNvbG9zc3VzIEJsYWRlIiwidGFibGV2YXIiOiJ0YWJsZVZhcmlhYmxlSUFTIiwicHdpYXMiOiIwIiwic3dpYXMiOiIwIiwiaWFzIjoiMCIsImZhbmF0IjoiMCIsImJvcyI6IjAiLCJ3dyI6IjAiLCJmcmVuenkiOiIwIiwiaGYiOiIwIiwiZGVjcmVwIjpmYWxzZSwib25laGFuZCI6ZmFsc2UsIndzbWJ1ZyI6ZmFsc2V9). There are cases where it will though.

In all other scenarios for Barbarian, Unbending Will simply acts as a cheaper (and slightly inferior) alternative to Oath and would work sufficiently well as such. Another plus of Unbending Will is due to it having +10 Strength and -% req, it can be used to Auto WSM Bug.
