### Overall Usage

Originally Plague was all weapons, which offered the ability to put it into Claws, Daggers, and even Sorceress Orbs. Now that it is Swords only, I don't see a use for it. I can't think of any build where this is good on. Maybe a Zealot before Grief if you somehow have Cham + Um and no Lo? Some people think this will be good on Act 5 Mercenaries for a cheap Infinity, but I don't think that's true. Act 5 Mercenaries can cast Battle Cry now, which will overwrite the Lower Resist proc frequently. Hard to know if it would actually end up being useful or not. Maybe just as a general damage dealing Act 5 Mercenary weapon runeword, Lower Resist aside. Also, enjoy having no shrines :)
