Note: the variation rolls are not confirmed to be correct, they are the old variation rolls. They may have changed.

Being a 3 socket runeword that can be put into all weapons, this means any weapon that can get 3 open sockets, INCLUDING Claws and Sorceress Orbs (YES, I TESTED IT).

Notes:
- 13-17 Cleansing provides 75-78% PLR and CLR to the current length every 2 seonds.
  - CLR (Curse Length Reduction) WILL reduce Shrine duration! You will have very limited shrine duration while Cleansing is on.

### Assassin Usage

This would make a good hybrid claw for Trapper+MA sins and a great pure claw for elemental MA sins. With both Fade and Cleansing, while you will not be curse immune, curses will expire extremely quickly, as would shrines.

I see this being a meta option (perhaps not best in slot, though..) for new Phoenix Striker. Put it into Runic Talons with +3 Phoenix Strike and you would have a great elemental stat stick while still doing great physical damage (380% ED is a lot).

Additionally, the -23 Poison Res would boost Venom damage as well, making this an extremely good runeword for Assassins. Likely best in slot (or competing for best in slot) for several builds.

### Sorceress Usage

While this runeword could be put into a Sorceress Orb, a Rare Orb with +2 Sorc skills would be better. None of the other mods are useful for a Sorc.

### Druid Usage

This could potentially be a good item for Rabies Druid. The caveat here is only 20 weapon IAS. More theory needed.

### Necromancer Usage

This can fit into a Dagger, thus it may be a viable option for Dagger Necromancer. I dont think it's better than Blackbogs though.
