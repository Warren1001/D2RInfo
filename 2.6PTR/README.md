# Put d2s files into `Users/Saved Games/Diablo II Resurrected (PTR)/` folder.

- `newptrrws.d2s` only contains the runes for the runewords and some useful bases.

# Extract .rar file contents into (install location) `Diablo II Resurrected Public Test/mods/` folder. You will have to create the `mods` folder.
- Path should read `../Diablo II Resurrected Public Test/mods/mosaic/mosaic.mpq/..`
- In the Blizzard Client, set `Game Version` for D2R to `Public Test Realm` then click the settings cog. For `Additional command line arguments`, put `-mod mosaic -txt`
- The 50% Mosaic runeword is the same as the original, but the Thul Rune is an El Rune. El Rune has been modified to give the same stats as Thul Rune.
